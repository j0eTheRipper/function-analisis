# function-analisis

Recieves a linear-function as an input as outputs information about that function.

## Example:

input: y = 2x + 5

output:

Standard ==> -2x + y = 5
Slope intercept ==> y = 2x + 5
Point slope ==> y - 17 = 2(x - 6)

Information about the function:
Slope ==> 2
x-intercept ==> -2.5
y-intercept ==> 5
